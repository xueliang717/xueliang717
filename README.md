Hi, I'm Xue Liang, a junior in Computer Science. I'm deeply interested in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science, and I'm currently exploring machine learning algorithms and Computer Vision. I enjoy working on projects that combine creativity and technology, such as developing a recommendation system for online courses or analyzing social media trends. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about the latest tech advancements, playing chess, or exploring new music. I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative ideas and contribute to open-source projects. Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or have exciting opportunities!
